## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used for not just this Congressional district, but Senatorial districts and local elections. They do not have to be from these 3 counties, but other counties in the state of Colorado.  Modifications to the script could also be modified to find the winning candidate from each county. We could see if a candidate performed better in one county over another. We can also modify the script to add all other candidates from other types of elections to include local and regional elections and give each precinct or cities areas.
